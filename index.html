			<h1>About</h1>
         <div class="about-left-col">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>As a software generalist, I love positions where I can wear many hats, from developing web user interfaces to writing Linux scripts to automate a build or deployment process. I am experienced enough to recommend designs, approaches, and tools. I'm also flexible and willing to adopt and contribute to existing processes. I enjoy the challenge of launching a new project, but I recogize that most of a developer's work involves building on the work of others, and I'm not above diving into existing code to make enhancements and fix bugs.
         </div>
         <div class="about-right-col">
            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>With four years of experience as a software project manager, I can take ownership of all aspects of getting a new or redesigned product off the ground and launched. From requirements definition through wireframes and usability testing to implementation and deployment, I enjoy managing the details and interacting with all of the involved stakeholders. I have experience with the tools and techniques involved in leading an agile development team. Most importantly, I love working with and learning from teams of great people.</p>

               <p>I proposed the idea for this tool to NREL management and the government customer and obtained funding for the project. I Designed and reviewed mockups of the UI layout over multiple iterations and secured the right to use the underlying data set from a partner organization. I led a small team of developers who implemented the tool using PHP and Oracle. Throughout the development process I maintained the project budget and schedule and provided regular status updates. The project was completed on time and on budget.</p>
